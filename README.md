### Connection settings

The following settings are required to connect to the ADP Workforce:

| Setting      | Description                        | Mandatory   |
| ------------ | -----------                        | ----------- |
| BaseUrl      | The BaseUrl to the ADP Workforce environment | Yes |
| ClientID     | The ClientID for the ADP Workforce environment. This will be provided by ADP | Yes |
| ClientSecret | The ClientSecret for the ADP Workforce environment. This will be provided by ADP | Yes |
| CertificatePath | The location to the 'private key of the x.509 certificate' on the server where the HelloID agent and provisioning agent are running. Make sure to use the private key for the certificate that's used to generate a ClientID and ClientSecret and for activating the required API's | Yes |
| CertificatePassword | The password for the *.pfx certificate | Yes |
| Toggle debug logging | When toggled, debug logging will be displayed | No |

### Prerequisites

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 installed on the server where the 'HelloID agent and provisioning agent' are running.

- The public key *.pfx certificate belonging to the X.509 certificate that's used to activate the required API's.

- The password for the public key *.pfx certificate.

- The 'Execute on-premises' switch on the 'System' tab is toggled.

> The emailaddress is updated using a POST call to: https://api.eu.adp.com/events/hr/v1/worker.businesscommunication.email.change. additional rights to this endpoint is required and should be requested by the customer at customer support of ADP.

#### X.509 certificate / public key

To obtain access to the ADP Workforce API's, a x.509 certificate is needed. This certificate has to be created by the customer.

The public key belonging to the certificate, must be send ADP. ADP will then generate a ClientID and ClientSecret and will activate the required API's.
